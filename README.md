# whelan

This is a python script for dumping http traffic using pylibpcap.

I have a need to know the exact parameters being sent to our servers
from certain devices, without any access to the server logs themselves.
So with whelan I will have those devices hooked up to a network where
I can sniff the traffic and determine the way in which our services
are used.
